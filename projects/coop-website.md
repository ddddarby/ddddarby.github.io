I lived in a coop for awhile and whenever I encountered any kind of social friction or communication inefficiency I tried to fix it the only way I knew how: web design. At one point it was connected to a paypal account where people could pay rent online, hosted a community calendar where people could post events, active communal projects.

On the nerdy end of things, it was the first time I was trying to write html semantically, use a css framework (in this case [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)) and a lightweight cms tool that created a wysiwig editing experience so non-technical residents could edit things like contact information without logging into an intimidating backend or using terminal.

I briefly entertained the idea of spinning this in to a start up for other coops but was discouraged after realizing it was just a very over engineered google doc and google docs are free.
