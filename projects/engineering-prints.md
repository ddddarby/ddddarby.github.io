Engineer Prints use a print process meant for large architectural and industrial plans. They’ve been around for awhile and it’s no secret that you can hop over to a nearby big box print shop to get them done for super cheap.

But wouldn’t it be way easier to just upload the photo you wanted and have trained printers resize, format, and ship your print? We all said we’d pay a few extra dollars for the convenience. A few months later Engineer Prints by Photojojo was born.

I designed and built the first engineering print site and styled the super simple checkout. I also designed stickers for the packaging and the confirmation email.
