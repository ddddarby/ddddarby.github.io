title: 'GitHub Sponsors Landing Page'
---
I worked with GitHub's brand and marketing team to refresh the landing page of [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/), a way for open source maintainers to crowdfund directly on GitHub. The program was new at the time and we believed that early visitors on the page would need to be convinced that open source software was valuable and the maintainers behind these projects needed to be compensated. I am very happy to say that the cultural norms have shifted for the better and it's no longer absurd to ask people and companies to "pay for the software you use".
