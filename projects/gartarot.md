title: 'Gartarot'
---

In 2018 I hosted an art workshop where we discussed the history of copyright law, fair use, publishing work with [creative commons permissions](https://creativecommons.org/), and when you can sell derivative work for profit.

At the end of the discussion, I asked everyone to randomly select a tarot card and redraw it to feature Garfield or characters from the extended Garfield Universe. We had exactly the right number of people to complete the Major Arcana (Major Gar-cana...?). We decided to publish the artwork under a [CC BY-NC 4.0 DEED](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/?ref=chooser-v1) license which means people are free to share, remix, and use the art we created as long as it was credited to our group and it was used non-commercially.
