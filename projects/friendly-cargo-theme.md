I made a [Cargo](https://cargo.site/) theme for a friend last weekend. The themes on Cargo tend to be kind of stoic and austere. My friend wanted something with a little bit more personality and little bit more color. We came up with Friendly Theme, a simple theme thatâ€™s focused on displaying text-heavy projects.
