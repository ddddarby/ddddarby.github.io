The themes on [Cargo](https://cargo.site) tend to be kind of stoic and austere. I worked with a designer who wanted something with a little bit more personality and little bit more color. We came up with Friendly Theme, a simple theme thatâ€™s focused on displaying text-heavy projects. She designed it, I coded it.
