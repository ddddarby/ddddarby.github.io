title: 'Supper club'
---
In Spring 2022 I helped run a supper club out of my apartment and backyard in the Upper Haight in San Francisco. Our concept was a bring-your-own-toppings pizza club where my husband and I would provide the dough, oven, and pizza sauce and our guests would bring the rest. 

We hosted a courageous 4 events before throwing in the towel. What I learned from this experience is that every restaurant is a miracle. All we have left now are memories and these promotional graphics I made.
