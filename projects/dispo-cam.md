The Photojojo Disposable Camera App was available in the Apple App Store from March 2015 to August 2015. You downloaded the app, took 27 photos with it, and you’d see your pictures for the very first time as real prints that we printed and mailed to you. I developed the branding, identity, and graphic illustration, packaging and marketing site.

## Packaging
<div class="image-row">
    <img src="/assets/img/projects/dispo-cam/thumb-30.jpg" alt="product photo" class="responsive-image row-three">
    <img src="/assets/img/projects/dispo-cam/thumb-31.jpg" alt="product photo" class="responsive-image row-three">
    <img src="/assets/img/projects/dispo-cam/thumb-32.jpg" alt="product photo" class="responsive-image row-three">
</div>
I designed the print graphics for the mailing envelope, the print sleeve wrap and a sticker that turns the prints into insta-postcards.

## App
I designed the look and feel of the app and worked with a team of developers to work out a UI that was both fun and functional.

## Marketing Site
The site you’d go to if you wanted more info about the app.
