I’m Darby, a senior product designer with 10+ years of experience, based in Berkeley California. I’ve been helping creators get paid first at <a href="https://patreon.com">Patreon</a> and now at <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>. Before that I was the in house designer and front end developer with the team at Photojojo.
